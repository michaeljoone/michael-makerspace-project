      <h2>Project Title</h2>
     <h3>A Maker Space Approach to teaching Project Documentation</h3>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction / Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project explores how Pierce College’s Maker Space can enhance student learning in CONT260: Construction Project Management by offering hands-on experience through design and fabrication. The core activity involves creating a small-scale wooden house model using the Glowforge laser cutter.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this project is to give students a real-world understanding of construction workflows. By moving through the stages of planning, communicating with a design team, making revisions, and executing a build, students engage in a process that mirrors professional project management. The Maker Space will be a practical extension of the classroom, allowing theory to be put into action.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Course / Curriculum Info</h2>
      <p>CONT260: Construction Project Management at Pierce College. The course focuses on key skills such as construction planning, documentation systems, team coordination, and schedule tracking.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
      <p>This project supports the following learning outcome from CONT260: “Create documentation procedures and information management systems.”</p>
      <p> It also builds on specific learning by encouraging:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Application of digital fabrication tools</li>
        <li>Real-time design adjustments based on technical constraints</li>
        <li>Process documentation and revision tracking</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Materials</h2>
      <p>The following materials and tools were used in the project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Glowforge laser cutter (provided by the Maker Space)</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Adobe Illustrator (used by the Maker Space design studio to convert drawings)</li>
        <li><strong>Consumables:</strong> Thin plywood sheets for the Glowforge model cut (Maker Space)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All resources were accessible through the Maker Space, with support from both the staff and design studio team.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Process / Procedure</h2>
      <h3>1. Initial Planning</h3>
      <p>Outlined the project and selected CONT260 as the course connection. Reviewed the syllabus and selected the learning outcome related to documentation. Met with Maker Space staff to discuss feasibility and steps.</p>

      <h3>2. Hand-Drawn Design Submission</h3>
          <p>Students who may not feel confident in their drawing skills, can search for Glowforge-compatible house designs online or use my model as a reference. Here's one example from the Glowforge community that provides a simple, ready-to-use house design: <a href="https://community.glowforge.com/t/simple-house/51979" target="_blank">this Glowforge community house design</a> if they're unsure about their own drawing skills.</p>
          <p>The goal isn't to create a perfect design, but to go through the entire process of planning, revising, communicating, and submitting just like in real life construction projects. This reinforces the CONT260 outcome focused on documentation and information management systems.</p>
          <p>I created a hand-drawn design for a small wooden house model. The initial layout included five walls, a pitched roof, window and door cutouts, and a small garage area. This drawing served as the foundation for the digital file that would later be used by the Glowforge.</p>

      <h4>Student Guidance Note (Maker Space)</h4>
      <p>It’s important to know that connecting with the Maker Space team may take persistence. Often, no one is immediately available, so students might need to visit multiple times before speaking with someone directly. When that happens:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain your project clearly when you meet someone in person</li>
        <li>Ask for their direct email (do not rely on the Maker Space brochure because the QR code may not work and the general contact email may not respond)</li>
        <li>Send a follow-up email and keep checking in to stay on their radar</li>
        <li>Coordinate early and often to secure design help, machine time, and documentation support</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This mirrors the real world communication challenges in construction management learning how to work with different teams, stay on schedule, and keep documentation moving forward.
</p>

     <h3>3. Design Conversion Session</h3>
      <p>The design conversion session was held at the Maker Studio inside the Pierce College Fort Steilacoom Library. Working with the design studio team, we used Adobe Illustrator to turn my sketch into a SVG( Scalable Vector Graphics) file for the Glowforge cutting.</p>
      <p>Key changes and decisions made:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjusted the original measurements for better alignment</li>
        <li>Refined the garage lines for clean cuts</li>
        <li>Standardized all windows to rectangular shapes for consistency</li>
        <li>Removed the sloped roof to simplify the assembly process</li>
        <li>Fit all parts onto a single Glowforge cutting page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These adjustments reflected real construction management practices and adapting plans based on structural and technical constraints.</p>
      <p>At the end of the session, I was handed off to the Maker Space team to move forward with the Glowforge cutting phase and assembly process.</p>
    
    <h3>Cutting Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Glowforge was turned on and connected to an air filter to prevent smoke</li>
      <li>A fresh 10” x 20” x 1/8” plywood sheet was secured in the machine</li>
      <li>The design file was loaded, and the cut was initiated</li>
      <li>The full cutting process took approximately 21 minutes and 41 seconds</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Final Assembly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All edges were sanded to ensure they were level</li>
      <li>Parts were carefully glued together, beginning with the walls and finishing with the roof</li>
      <li>The final house model was successfully assembled</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</h3>
    <p>The WBS below outlines the full project in a hierarchical format. It breaks the work into key phases and tasks, reflecting construction industry project management practices. Creating the WBS helped structure the project and track progress, while giving students direct experience in managing task flow and deliverables.</p>
    <img src="image/wbs.jpeg" alt="A table titled Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for a Maker Space House Model Project. The table has three columns labeled WBS Code, Task Name, and Description. Rows list tasks such as Maker Space House Model Project, Initial Planning, Communication with Maker Space, Sketch and Design Development, Digital File Preparation, Design Revisions, Glowforge Cutting Preparation, Cutting Execution, Assembly, Documentation and Visuals, and Final Technical Report. Each task includes a brief description, for example, Initial Planning defines goals and reviews course outcome, while Cutting Execution involves operating the Glowforge to cut components. The table is presented on a white background with a calm and organized tone. All text is clearly legible." style="width: 700px; height: 300px;" >
